There are **recurring problems** due to either **government's laxity** or lack of **enduring solution**, such as economic recession, **budget deficit**. Not only does government **play a regulatory role in** these issues, but also it is the government **has the authority to** tackle them. 

These problems **are already high on government's agenda**, and the government has **formulated** a bunch of policies and **impose bans on** few economic actions. 

But they all seems **short-sighted** in some ways, hence the citizens are against these **countermeasures**. People believe that the government **would be well-advised to** take surveys before actions.
